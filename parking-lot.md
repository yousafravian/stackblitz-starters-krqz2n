Goals: Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles. This will test candidates problem solving as well as software design skills.
Time to complete: 20-25 minutes
Language: Any programming language

Here are a few methods that you should be able to run:
Tell us how many spots are remaining
Tell us how many total spots are in the parking lot
Tell us when the parking lot is full
Tell us when the parking lot is empty
Tell us when certain spots are full e.g. when all motorcycle spots are taken

Assumptions:
The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans
The parking lot has motorcycle spots, car spots and large spots
A motorcycle can park in any spot
A car can park in a single compact spot, or a regular spot
